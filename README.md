# A Survey of Non-functional Optimization for Mobile Applications

This is the repository of the [living survey on non-functional optimization of mobile applications](https://solar.cs.ucl.ac.uk/appoptimization.github.io/), which accompanies the paper [**A Survey of Non-functional Optimization for Mobile Applications**](https://solar.cs.ucl.ac.uk/os/app_optimization.html) currently under review at the IEEE TSE journal.

The research on non-functional optimization for mobile applicaitons is evolving fast. Therefore, we aim to keep this survey as a living document. We encourage anyone to add new publications following the [instructions](https://solar.cs.ucl.ac.uk/appoptimization.github.io/contribution.html) and open pull requests.

This **living survey** has been inspired by the work of [Allamanis et al. on Machine Learning for Big Code and Naturalness](https://ml4code.github.io/). We thank them for making publicly available their repository and allowing its use for other surveys like ours.
