Energy efficiency is a critical factor in mobile systems, and a significant body of recent research efforts has focused on reducing the energy dissipation in mobile hardware and applications. The Android OS Power Manager provides programming interface routines called wakelocks for controlling the activation state of devices on a mobile system. An appropriate placement of wakelock acquire and release functions in the application can make a significant difference to the energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a data flow analysis based strategy for determining the placement of wakelock statements corresponding to the uses of devices in an application. Our experimental evaluation on a set of Android applications show significant (up to 32%) energy savings with the proposed optimization strategy.
