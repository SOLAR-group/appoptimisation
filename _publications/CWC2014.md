Current energy-saving color design approaches can be classified into two categories, namely, context-aware dimming and color remapping. The former darkens individual regions with respect to the user interactions, and the latter replaces the color set with a new color set that yields lower energy consumption. Both schemes have drawbacks: color dimming tends to cause loss of perceptual quality, and color remapping is an offline color design process.

This paper introduces a novel saliency-guided color dimming scheme for OLED displays in both the context of 3D visualization and 2D visualization. The key idea is to eliminate undesired details while enhancing the visually salient features of each frame on-the-fly by leveraging the color and spatial information. A parallelizable image-space salient region detection algorithm is introduced to make the entire process GPU-friendly and real-time. We apply our approach on several representative visualization scenarios and conduct a preliminary user study. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of our approach.
