Frame refreshes, that are used to retain frame images from frame buffers for display subsystems in mobile devices, waste energy and memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an intelligent frame refresh mechanism to reduce redundant frame refreshes and useless data accesses to frame buffers, which bridges the semantic gap between frame buffers and frame refreshes, and exploits the knowledge of frame buffers to guide frame refreshes. Based on this mechanism, we introduce two detailed schemes to optimize refreshes by utilizing different information. The flipping-aware frame refresh scheme uses the frame buffer switching operations to detect frame image updates and triggers useful refreshes. The row-level frame refresh scheme supports to refresh only modified rows instead of the whole frame, under the guidance of pixel status information of frame buffers. Our evaluation results show that our proposed mechanism can reduce memory requests by nearly 50% and memory power consumption up to 30%, compared to conventional fixed frame refresh mechanism.
