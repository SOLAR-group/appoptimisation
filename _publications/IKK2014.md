In  this  paper,  The  mobile  application  field  has  been  receiving  astronomical  attention  from  the past  few  years  due  to  the  growing  number  of  mobile app  downloads  and  withal  due  to  the revenues  being  engendered  .With  the  surge  in  the  number  of  apps,  the  number  of  lamentable apps/failing  apps  has  withal  been  growing.Interesting  mobile  app  statistics  are  included  in  this paper  which  might avail the  developers  understand  the  concerns and  merits  of mobile  apps.The authors  have  made  an  effort  to  integrate  all  the  crucial  factors  that  cause  apps  to  fail  which include  negligence  by  the  developers,  technical  issues,  inadequate  marketing  efforts,  and  high prospects  of  the  users/consumers.The  paper  provides  suggestions  to  eschew  failure  of  apps.  As per the various surveys, the number of lamentable/failing apps is growing enormously, primarily because  mobile  app  developers  are  not  adopting  a  standard  development  life  cycle  for  the development  of  apps.  In  this  paper,  we  have  developed  a  mobile  application  with  the  aid  of traditional  software  development  life  cycle  phases (Requirements,  Design,  Develop,  Test,  and, Maintenance)   and   we   have   used   UML,   M-UML,   and   mobile   application   development technologies.
