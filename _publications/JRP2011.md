Application launch performance is of great importance
to system platform developers and vendors as it greatly
affects the degree of usersâ€™ satisfaction. The single most
effective way to improve application launch performance
is to replace a hard disk drive (HDD) with a solid state
drive (SSD), which has recently become affordable and
popular. A natural question is then whether or not to
replace the traditional HDD-aware application launchers
with a new SSD-aware optimizer.
We address this question by analyzing the inefficiency
of the HDD-aware application launchers on SSDs and
then proposing a new SSD-aware application prefetching
scheme, called the Fast Application STarter (FAST). The
key idea of FAST is to overlap the computation (CPU)
time with the SSD access (I/O) time during an application launch. FAST is composed of a set of user-level
components and system debugging tools provided by the
Linux OS (operating system). In addition, FAST uses a
system-call wrapper to automatically detect application
launches. Hence, FAST can be easily deployed in any
recent Linux versions without kernel recompilation. We
implemented FAST on a desktop PC with a SSD running
Linux 2.6.32 OS and evaluated it by launching a set of
widely-used applications, demonstrating an average of
28% reduction of application launch time as compared
to PC without a prefetcher.
