Memory deduplication, which can remedy memory scarcity in mobile systems, can hardly be used due to its high computation cost. This paper proposes a computation efficient memory deduplication scheme that avoids unnecessary computations for memory deduplication. Our prototype shows significant computation cost reduction while providing the same memory savings as in previous approaches.
