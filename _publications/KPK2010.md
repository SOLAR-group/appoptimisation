Offloading computation from smartphones to remote cloud resources has recently been rediscovered as a technique to enhance the performance of smartphone applications, while reducing the energy usage.

In this paper we present the first practical implementation of this idea for Android: the Cuckoo framework, which simplifies the development of smartphone applications that benefit from computation offloading and provides a dynamic runtime system, that can, at runtime, decide whether a part of an application will be executed locally or remotely. We evaluate the framework using two real life applications.
