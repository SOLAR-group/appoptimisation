This paper proposes a battery life time extension method using selective data reception on smartphone according to the battery states of a smartphone. In proposed method, the battery state information of a smartphone is transmitted to the corresponding application server with keep-alive signaling or initial signaling message. The SNS application server determines whether the received data transmits to a smartphone by considering the data types (e.g, picture, video, text, etc.). Accordingly, the battery life time of a smartphone can be extended by avoiding the energy which is caused due to unnecessary data reception. Also, the proposed method can decrease unnecessary bandwidth usage and signaling data.
