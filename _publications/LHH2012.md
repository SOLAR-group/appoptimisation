With the increasing variety of mobile applications, reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices is a major challenge in sustaining multimedia streaming applications. This paper explores how to minimize the energy consumption of the backlight when displaying a video stream without adversely impacting the user's visual experience. First, we model the problem as a dynamic backlight scaling optimization problem. Then, we propose algorithms to solve the fundamental problem and prove the optimality in terms of energy savings. Finally, based on the algorithms, we present a cloud-based energy-saving service. We have also developed a prototype implementation integrated with existing video streaming applications to validate the practicability of the approach. The results of experiments conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach are very encouraging and show energy savings of 15-49 percent on commercial mobile devices.
