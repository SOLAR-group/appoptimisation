OLED power management on mobile devices is very challenging due to the dynamic nature of human-screen interaction. This paper presents the design, algorithms, and implementation of a lightweight mobile app called ShiftMask, which allows the user to dynamically shift OLED power to the portion of interest, while dimming the remainder of the screen based on visual acuity. To adapt to the user's focus of attention, we propose efficient algorithms that consider visual fixation in static scenes, as well as changes in focus and screen scrolling. The results of experiments conducted on a commercial smartphone with popular interactive apps demonstrate that ShiftMask can achieve substantial energy savings, while preserving acceptable readability.
