Android has been researched in various mobile device fields such as Smartphone and Tablet PC. In here, we should remember that mobile devices have limited storage and constrained battery life. Therefore, when developers develop applications, they should do efficient programming. In this paper, we have proposed programming guidelines for an effective way to improve performance in Android applications. We have programmed Android applications using Java and Native C, and compared the performance between the two languages. The applications are composed of five categories such as JNI delay, Integer, Floating-point, Memory access algorithm and String processing. By analyzing the results, we propose a more efficient way to program Android applications.
