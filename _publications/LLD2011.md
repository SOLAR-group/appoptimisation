Google's Android Native Development Kit (NDK) is a toolset that lets you embed components to use of native code in your Android applications. It makes possible for developers to easily compile in C/C++ for the Android development platform. Generally, developer does not concern how effective between native code and Dalvik Java code that will causes poor performance of Android. There are some researches discussed about benchmark Java and C/C++. But they do not consider the issues of Dalvik and native code for Android programming or evaluate them in real Android device. In this work, we use a more complete approach to benchmark Dalvik java code and Native code on real Android device. We conducted 12 test programs to analyze the performance and found that native code faster than Dalvik Java code for about 34.2%.
