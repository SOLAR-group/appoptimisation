With millions of smartphones sold every year, the development of mobile apps has grown substantially. The battery power limitation of mobile devices has push developers and researchers to search for methods to improve the energy efficiency of mobile apps. We propose a multiobjective refactoring approach to automatically improve the architecture of mobile apps, while controlling for energy efficiency. In this extended abstract we briefly summarize our work.
