For smartphone users, application launching time, which is period from time of application icon touch by a user to time at which the application starts interacting with the user, is one of the most important performances for comfortable uses. In this paper, we focus on Android devices and discuss methods for measuring application launching time and decreasing launching time. First, we introduce a method for measuring application launching time by inserting monitoring functions into Android operating system. Second, we present our measurement results of application launching times. Third, we focus on class loading process and discuss a ways for decreasing application launching time. It expands the list of preloaded classes by adding standard classes. Last, we present our evaluation results and demonstrate that the proposed method can improve launching time.
