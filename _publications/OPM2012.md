Smartphones with an embedded GPS sensor are being increasingly used for location determination to enable Location based services (LBS) deliver location context pervasive computing services such as maps and navigation. Although a Smartphone GPS provides adequate accuracy, it has limitations such as high energy consumption and is unavailable in locations with an obscured view of GPS satellites. Use of alternate location sensors such as Wi-Fi and GSM can be used to augment GPS and to alleviate these GPS limitations, but they can increase the average localization error. The novelty of our contribution is twofold. First we present an accelerometer based architecture that reduces GPS energy-consumption without compromising on either the location accuracy or sampling rate. Evaluation of our system shows energy-savings of up to 27% in typical circumstances. Second, as a user's mobility state is complex we also propose a method to not only detect that a user is non-stationary but also classify a representative set of mobility states.
