This paper argues that a new class of bugs faced by millions of smartphones, energy bugs or ebugs, have become increasingly prominent that already they have led to significant user frustrations. We take a first look at this emerging important technical challenge faced by the smartphones, ebugs, broadly defined as an error in the system (application, OS, hardware, firmware, external conditions or combination) that causes an unexpected amount of high energy consumption by the system as a whole. We first present a taxonomy of the kinds of ebugs based on mining over 39K posts (1.2M before filtering) from 4 online mobile user forum and mobile OS bug repositories. The taxonomy shows the highly diverse nature of smartphone ebugs. We then propose a roadmap towards developing a systematic diagnosing framework for debugging ebugs on smartphones.
