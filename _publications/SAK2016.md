Even after the introduction of Android Runtime (ART) in the latest release of Android Lollipop, Android Operating System still struggles in areas such as application launch time, especially during sluggish or memory crunch situations. When a new application is launched in a sluggish condition, low memory killer (LMK) gets initiated in order to free some memory by killing the already running applications. The current LMK approach kills application based on how recently it was used. This approach does not consider various other user scenarios such as how frequently the application was launched or how important that application is to user. In our proposed solution, we aim to improve user experience by reducing or removing the delay at memory crunch situations with efficient use of LMK.
