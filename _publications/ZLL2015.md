Smartphones are becoming increasingly energy-hungry to support feature-rich applications, posing a lot of pressure on battery lifetime and making energy consumption a non-negligible issue. In particular, dynamic random access memory (DRAM)-based main memory subsystem is a major contributor to the energy consumption of mobile devices. In this paper, we propose direct read (DR). Swap, an energy-efficient in-memory paging design to reduce energy consumption in smartphones. In DR. Swap, we adopt emerging energy-efficient nonvolatile memory (NVM) and use it as the swap area. Utilizing NVMs byte-addressability, we propose DR which guarantees zero memory copy for read-only requests when accessing a page in swap area. To better understand the energy consumption of swapping, we build an energy model to analyze the energy consumption of different paging architectures. We evaluate DR. Swap based on the Google Nexus 5 smartphone, experimental results show that our technique can reduce more than 50% energy consumption compared to DRAM backed swapping.
