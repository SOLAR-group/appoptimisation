title: A survey on non-functional characteristics of mobile applications
---

### Non-functional application optimization

The relevance of mobile (handheld) devices, such as the so-called smartphones,
has been ever growing for the past 10 years
([3.2 billion smartphone users in 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/)).
Smartphones can nowadays be considered as the main information processing devices for users.
Even though mobile devices are powerful,
they represent resource-constrained devices making the development of applications
that can run on them (mobile applications) challenging.
To ensure user satisfaction and success of mobile applications,
it is important to provide highly performant applications.
This website surveys the work on the emerging area of non-functional optimization for mobile applications.
In particular, performance characteristics of mobile applications include:
responsiveness, launch time, memory, and energy consumption.

### Contribution

The research on non-functional application optimization is evolving fast.
Therefore, we aim at making this website a living literature review.
We encourage anyone to add a paper relevant to this web site,
